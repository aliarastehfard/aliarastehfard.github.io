## About me

Hi! I'm Ali, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Connecticut specializing in applied cryptography.
My research focuses on privacy-preserving information retrieval and secure computation.
Recently, I’ve been exploring Private RAG, particularly in the context of scalable private web search.
Beyond my own work, I’ve grown increasingly interested in AI security and, through my lab,
have had the opportunity to collaborate on several exciting projects.
Outside of research, I enjoy playing tennis, hiking new trails, and reading books—especially on social and
behavioral psychology.
